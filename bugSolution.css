To solve the issue, add `overflow: hidden;` to the parent container's CSS. This forces the parent container to contain the floated elements, preventing them from overflowing and causing layout issues.  Alternatively, you could use `clear: both;` on an element after the floated elements.

```css
.parent {
  overflow: hidden;
}
/*or*/
.clear {
  clear: both;
}
```
