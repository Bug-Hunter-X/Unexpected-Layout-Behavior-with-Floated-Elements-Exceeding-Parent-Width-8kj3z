The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the total width of the `div` elements exceeds the parent container's width.  In some cases, the extra width might cause unexpected horizontal scrolling or overlapping elements. This is due to the `float` property's interaction with the browser's rendering engine.
